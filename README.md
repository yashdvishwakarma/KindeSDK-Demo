# KindeSDK-Demo

This repository demonstrates a minimal .NET SDK wrapper for Kinde's authentication API. It showcases:

- Structured exception handling using custom exceptions.
- Logging of authentication errors.
- Separation of concerns with dedicated classes for authentication logic and exception handling.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Replace `"your-client-id"` and `"your-client-secret"` in `Program.cs` with your Kinde credentials.
3. Run the application to see the authentication process in action.
